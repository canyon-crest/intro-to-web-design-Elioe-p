  <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
  <p>My name is Phoebe Wang, and I am currently a sophomore at Canyon Crest Academy. I have always been passionate about computer science, and I’m now taking an APSCP course, which motivates me to keep learning and improving on computing knowledge. Growing up, I developed a strong curiosity about how things work and enjoy exploring new ideas. I consider myself a responsible and motivated person who values honesty and teamwork. My goal is to continue developing my skills and make a meaningful impact in my future career.</p>

  <h2>Educations</h2>
  <p>I am currently taking APCSP and AP chem, where I have learned both academic knowledge and practical problem-solving skills. And I will be taking AP bio, Calculus, and AP Physics in the future. I enjoy challenges because they push me to think critically and find better solutions. And I’m willing to take AP classes, aiming for a good GPA. In addition to my studies, I actively participate in clubs and volunteers to gain real-world experience. I believe that learning should be a lifelong journey and not restricted in schools.</p>

  <h2>Hobbies and Future Goals</h2>
  <p>Outside of school, I have a wide range of hobbies such as coding, reading, jogging, playing badminton, etc. These activities help me relax from the school work and release pressure. I also like to connect with people from different backgrounds, as I believe communication is the key to understanding and collaboration. In the future, I hope to gain achievements in computing and go to a great college. And I wish I can find a job related to digital technology or programming in the future. I will continuously learn and work hard to achieve my dreams and contribute positively to society.</p>
